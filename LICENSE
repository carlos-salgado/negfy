NEGFY license agreement:

NEGFY is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation, according to version 3 of the License.

NEGFY is based on 3 open source codes which are also covered by the GNU General Public License v3: ALACANT, Erkale and Libint, whose license terms follow:


ALACANT Licence Agreement:
ALACANT is distributed to academic institutions after registration and agreement to this Licence. Please read it carefully and accept it if you agree to these conditions.

General:
ALACANT is package for electronic quantum transport. The project started in the year 2000 at the Physics Department of the University of Alicante with the aim to compute the current in nanoscopic systems starting from first principles. At present ALACANT consists of two codes: ANT.G03, which interfaces with GAUSSIAN03 to implement the non-equilibrium Green's functions formalism and ANT.1D, a stand-alone code which can be used in combination with any standard density functional theory based code using localized basis sets.

Authors:
The authors of ALACANT are
J. J. Palacios
D. Jacob
A. J. Pérez-Jiménez
E. Louis
E. San Fabián
J. A. Vergés

The “Copyright Holder” and the valid “Distributors” are the Authors mentioned above.

No Warranty:
The ALACANT package is provided by the Distributors "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. In no event shall the Distributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage. The entire risk as to the quality or performance of the program, or any action the Licensee may take based on the output of any part of the ALACANT package, is with the Licensee.

Usage:
The use of ALACANT under this agreement is restricted to academic institutions, including universities and nonmilitary
public research laboratories, and for academic purposes, i.e., leading to open publication of results, with neither withhold of
information nor intentional delay in publication. Notwithstanding these general definitions, the Authors reserve the exclusive right to determine what purposes and institutions are elegible for using the ALACANT package under this Licence, and to withhold the right to use the software where they are not satisfied that either condition is fulfilled. The Licensee is hereby provided with a nonexclusive, royaltyfree right to use any part of the ALACANT package, and to display, publish, perform, or otherwise use results obtained by use of the ALACANT package in any form, subject to the restriction that in any paper or other academic publication containing results wholly or partially derived from the results of use of the ALACANT package, the following papers must be cited in the normal manner:

Fullerene based molecular nanobridges: A firstprinciples study.
J. J. Palacios, E. Louis, A. J. Pérez Jiménez and J. A. Vergés.
Phys. Rev. B 64, 115411 (2001).

First principles approach to electrical transport in atomicscale nanostructures.
J. J. Palacios, A. J. PérezJiménez,
E. Louis, E. SanFabián, and J. A. Vergés.
Phys. Rev. B 66, 035322 (2002).

Implementing the Keldysh formalism into ab initio methods for the calculation of quantum transport: Application to metallic nanocontacts.
E. Louis, J. A. Vergés, J. J. Palacios, A. J. Pérez Jiménez and E. SanFabián.
Phys. Rev. B 67, 155321 (2003).

Other papers relevant to the ALACANT package and method should be cited as best scientific practice dictates. Licensees are recommended to reference to the Developers of any publication containing results wholly or partially derived from the results of use of the ALACANT package. The abovementioned right to use the code is extensive to the members of the research group of the Licensee as long as the use is in collaboration with the Licensee leading to coauthored publication(s).

Modifications:
Licensees are permitted to modify ALACANT for their own private use; in any paper containing results wholly or partially derived from the use of a modified version of ALACANT the authors are required to state that a privately modified version of ALACANT is used and satisfy the conditions of use stated above. The Developers encourage Licensees to submit their modifications of the ALACANT package to them, so that the ALACANT package does not fork, and furthermore so that the package can be improved for all users. Licensees can thereby benefit from the ulterior developments of ALACANT. To this end, the Developers wish to encourage Licensees to make any modifications to the ALACANT package in as modular a fashion as possible. This permits maintenance of these modifications as a separate entity in many cases, and may allow their separation from ALACANT and distribution as a separate piece of software: in that case, such software is not subject to this Licence, and the authors of the separate software are free to choose any licensing terms they desire. However, if a given modification must be incorporated directly into the ALACANT package, the author(s) of any such modifications must provide a perpetual, royaltyfree,
irrevocable license to the Authors and Developers, and the CopyrightHolder, to further modify their modifications ("the Contributed Code") as may prove necessary for the future development of ALACANT, and to distribute the Contributed Code (in its original or any later modified form) as part of the ALACANT package. The Developers, in the interests of maintaining the efficiency of the ALACANT package and the modularity of its code base, actively encourage all those considering modifications to the ALACANT package to discuss their planned modifications with the Developers beforehand.

Redistribution:
The authors reserve the exclusive right to distribute the ALACANT package. Licensees have no right to distribute the ALACANT package, a modified or alternative version thereof, or any other program making direct use of parts of the ALACANT package, without the prior written consent of the Distributors.

All other rights:
All other rights not explicitly mentioned in this document are reserved. In particular, the Authors reserve all rights to resolve any and all conflicts arising in the development and distribution policies of the ALACANT package. All Licensees, receiving the ALACANT package for any purpose, accept this by signing this Licence. This Licence takes effect when a copy of this document, signed and dated by the prospective Licensee, is received by the Distributors, and not before. Without a valid Licence, a prospective Licensee does not have the right to use or modify the ALACANT package. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Licence document, but changing it is not permitted. I agree to the terms and conditions of this Licence
